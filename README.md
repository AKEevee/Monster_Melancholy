<br/><br/>

Monster Melancholy Game (MMG) is a simplistic but fun adventure game! It was created simply as little project and as a way for us (specially [@AKEevee](https://github.com/AKeevee)) to express our creativity and passion. Do give it a go, downloading is quite easy (instructions linked above :D).

This was created as a side project so please excuse the roughness around the edges :)

## For Developers:

A few parts of the code (like decryption, encryption, server security, etc) are obfuscated due to security reasons, such as:
- The encrypt and decrypt functions
- In File "MHGdataHandle.h", line 87, the MongoDB connection URI is omitted

Thanks to:
- [Stephan-Brumme](https://create.stephan-brumme.com/hash-library) - Modified version of header files used for hashing
- [Mongo-C](http://mongoc.org) - MongoDB driver for C++
